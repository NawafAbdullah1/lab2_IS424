    <p>The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the bruin, from Middle English. This name originated
       in the fable History of Reynard the Fox translated by William Caxton from Middle Dutch bruun or bruyn, meaning brown (the color).
       [16][17] In themmid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes 
       as "Moccasin Joe". The brown bear(User arctos) is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America.
       Its conservation status is currently "Least Concern." There are many subspecies within 
       brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.
